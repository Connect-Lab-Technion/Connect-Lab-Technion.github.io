## Student Projects

A description of some of the offered student projects by ANPL, often in collaboration with other labs or companies, is given below. Projects at ANPL can be done either as part of academic coursework or as part-time employment. Feel free to contact us for additional project topics.

Motivated students from various departments at the Technion are encouraged to contact us right away!! For example, collaboration with the Center of Intelligent Systems in the Computer Science Department, allows CS undergrad and graduate students to perform projects at ANPL.

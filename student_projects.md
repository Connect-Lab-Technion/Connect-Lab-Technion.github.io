The Connect lab is always eager to welcome students to our group.  Motivated students from across the Technion are welcome to contact us to explore project options.  We have opportunities for hourly work and research/experimental projects for course credit.

Students are encouraged to visit the [Philadelphia Flight Control Lab](https://pfcl.technion.ac.il/projects/) website for many project opportunities in addition to the ones shown here.

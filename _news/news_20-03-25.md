description: Symmetry-Constrained Formation Maneuvering

---

Zamir Martinez, an MSc student in the group, presented his work on Symmetry-Constrained Formation Maneuvering.  Extending our recent results on Symmetry-forced formation control, Zamir has explored how these symmetric formations can also maneuver in space - including translation and rotation maneuvers - while maintaing the formation.  It was his first presentation in a conference.

The Israel Annual Conference on Aerospace Sciences (IACAS) is the flagship aerospace conference in Israel.

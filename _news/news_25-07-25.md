On July 30 I will give a talk as part of the Institute for Control Systems seminar series at TU Hamburg.  I will speak about our recent work on symmetry-forced formation control including new results on how we can maneuver such symmetry-constrained formations.  Looking forward to the visit and meeting Prof. Timm Faulwasser and his group!

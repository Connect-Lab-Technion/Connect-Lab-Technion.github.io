description: Advances in Rigidity Theory, Multi-Agent Formations, and Distributed Localization

---

We invite submissions to the open invited track:

**Advances in Rigidity Theory, Multi-Agent Formations, and Distributed Localization**

at the upcoming IFAC World Congress in Busan, Republic of Korea  
August 23–28, 2026  
[IFAC 2026 Website](https://www.ifac2026.org/)

Track Overview:

This invited track aims to bring together researchers working on the theoretical foundations and practical applications of graph rigidity, formation control, and distributed localization in multi-agent systems. Topics of interest include:

- Distance, bearing, angle, and sign rigidity theory  
- Distributed formation control  
- Localization using limited sensing and communication  
- Coordination across UAVs, ground vehicles, satellites, and more

More details can be found on the [session website](https://connect-lab-technion.github.io/ifac26-rigidity-formation)

Submission Instructions:

Please let us know your intent to contribute by October 1, 2025, by emailing:  
chenlm6@sustech.edu.cn

Submit your paper to IFAC 2026 as an “Open Invited Track Paper”  
Use the session code: **g46yu** during submission

The final paper submission deadline is November 26, 2025

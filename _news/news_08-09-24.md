title: "We will present 2 papers at CDC in Milano!"

description: Find us in the Sampled-Data Control and Nonlinear Output Feedback sessions!

We are looking forward to attending [CDC](https://cdc2024.ieeecss.org/) this year in Milano. We are presenting two works:

<ul><li> Miel Sharf and Daniel Zelazo, [A Characterization of All Passivizing Input-Output Transformations of a Passive-Short System](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10518141)
  </li></ul>
  This work studies the passivation problem for passive-short systems. We provide a characterization of all passifying controllers for a SISO passive-short system, a result that is in the same spirit as the celebrated Youla-Kuƒçera parameterization of all stabilizing controls of linear time-invariant systems. This result is an important step towards passivation design that can incorporate additional system performance metrics.

- Gal Barkai, Leonid Mirkin, and Daniel Zelazo, *"Asynchronous Sampled-Data Synchronization with Small Communications Delays"*
  
  This work studies the state synchronization of linear Time-Invariant (LTI) agents within a networked environment characterized by intermittent and asynchronous communication, alongside heterogeneous time-varying transmission delays. We propose a hybrid controller, augmented with a special kind of predictor, to compensate for the delays and guarantee synchronization.

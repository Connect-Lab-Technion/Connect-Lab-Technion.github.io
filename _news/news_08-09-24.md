title: "We will present 2 papers at CDC in Milano!"
date: 2024-09-08
description: Find us in the Sampled-Data Control and Nonlinear Output Feedback sessions!

---
We are looking forward to attend CDC this year in Milano.  We are presenting two works:
<ul>
<li> Miel Sharf and Daniel Zelazo, *A Characterization of All Passivizing Input-Output Transformations of a Passive-Short System*

This work studies the passivation problem for passive-short sytsems. We proivde a characterization of all passifying controllers for a SISO passive-short similar, a result that is in the same spirit as the celebrated Youla-Kuƒçera parameterization of all stabilizing controls of linear time-invariant systems.  This result is an important step towards passivation design that can incoroporate additional system performance metrics.</li>
<li> Gal Barkai, Leoind Mirkin, and Daniel Zelazo, *Asynchronous Sampled-Data Synchronization with Small Communications Delays*

This work studies the state synchronization of linear Time-Invariant (LTI) agents within a networked environment characterized by intermittent and asynchronous communication, alongside heterogeneous time-varying transmission delays. We propose a hybrid controller, augmented with a special kind of predictor,  to compensate for the delays and guarantee synchronization.</li>
</ul>

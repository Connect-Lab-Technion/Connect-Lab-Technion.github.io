The winter semester just started so we decided to open the year with a BBQ on the beach.  There were many reasons to celebrate, including

	* Solomon's passing of his PhD candidacy exam
	* Welcoming Xintong Chen to the group as she starts her MSc
	* Saying goodbye to Joseph who started a new job at Regulus
	* Saying goodbye to Gal who is on his way to a post-doc in France (although he couldn't join the party)
	
Of course, with ECC and IFAC conference deadlines looming, some good food on the beach helps! 
Looking forward to a productive start to the semester.

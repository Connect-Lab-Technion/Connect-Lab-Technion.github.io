description: Gal passed his PhD Exam.

We are thrilled to congratulate Dr. Gal Barkai on successfully passing his PhD examination!

Gal’s thesis, *Exploiting the Interplay Between Spatial and Temporal Constraints in the Control of Multi-Agent Systems*, presents significant contributions to the analysis and control of multi-agent systems, offering new perspectives on the interplay between spatial and temporal constraints in distributed coordination. His work provides both rigorous theoretical insights and practical frameworks that deepen our understanding of synchronization and agreement in complex networked systems.

Gal will soon begin a postdoctoral fellowship with Prof. Jamal Daafouz at the University of Lorraine, France, where he will continue advancing research at the intersection of control theory and networked dynamical systems.

Congratulations, Gal, on this outstanding achievement — we are proud of you and wish you continued success in your postdoctoral journey!

description: Bearing-only Formation Control with Directed Sensing

---

Congratulations to Jiacheng for his MSc degree.  Jiacheng completed his degree from the Technion Autonomous Systems Program (TASP).  His thesis, entitled "Bearing-only Formation Control with Directed Sensing", explores the formation control problem over directed graphs.  His excellent contribution was to extend the class of graphs, known as the Leader-First Follower (LFF) graphs, that can solve the bearing-only formation control problem with directed sensing.  We are working hard to submit his thesis work for publication!

Good luck on your next steps!

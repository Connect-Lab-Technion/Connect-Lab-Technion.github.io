description:  A Passivity Analysis for Nonlinear Consensus on Digraphs

---

Fengyu attended her first IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, held this year in Rio de Janiero, Brazil.  She gave a talk on her work **A Passivity Analysis for Nonlinear Consensus on Digraphs** in the *Network Analysis and Control I* session.

The paper develops a submanifold-constrained passivity viewpoint for nonlinear consensus on directed graphs. Instead of requiring the full closed-loop system to be passive in the ambient space, the analysis focuses on passivity relative to an invariant submanifold associated with the agreement (consensus) constraints. This shift makes it possible to prove convergence for a broad class of nonlinear node dynamics and asymmetric interaction structures, while keeping a clean geometric interpretation. It is pointing the way towards a new geometric viewpoint of passivity in general.

Nice work Fengyu!

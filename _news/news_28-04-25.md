The Connect Lab had a strong presence at the 2025 Israel Association of Automatic Control (IAAC) Conference held in Herzliya, contributing three presentations that reflect the labâ€™s broad expertise in coordination, control, and networked systems.

Each talk addressed timely challenges in multi-agent systems:

### ðŸ”¹ Fengyu Yue â€” *Passivity Analysis for Nonlinear Consensus Protocols over Directed Graphs*

Passivity theory provides a robust framework for analyzing large-scale and interconnected systems. However, its compositional properties break down in the presence of directed interactions due to the lack of symmetry. Fengyu introduced a novel approach using **loop transformations** and **submanifold stabilization** techniques to restore passivity-like properties, offering new tools for analyzing directed network dynamics.

### ðŸ”¹ Evyatar Matmon â€” *Leader Identification in Semi-Autonomous Consensus Protocols*

In networks with a mix of autonomous and leader-driven agents, determining which agents act as leaders is a fundamental problem. Evyatar presented a method to identify leaders solely through **velocity measurements**, leveraging structural properties of the network graph. His approach builds on relationships between the **Fiedler eigenvector** and **relative tempo measures**, offering a new perspective on observability in consensus systems.

### ðŸ”¹ Gal Barkai â€” *Two-Degree-of-Freedom Architectures for Consensus Control*

Traditional consensus protocols struggle to balance **fast convergence** with **robustness to noise and delays**. Gal demonstrated that the commonly used error-feedback structure is inherently limited in this regard. By introducing a **2-DOF control architecture**, he showed how to decouple local and global control tasksâ€”enabling simultaneous handling of disturbances, trajectory design, and performance shaping.

These contributions represent the Connect Lab's ongoing commitment to advancing the theory and application of multi-agent coordination and control. We are proud of Fengyu, Evyatar, and Gal for their excellent presentations and the impact of their research.

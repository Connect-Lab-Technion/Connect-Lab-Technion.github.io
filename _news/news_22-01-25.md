Alex Vasilyev and Arie Cohen-Salmon joined us this semester to spend a year in the lab as part of their research project graduation requirement in the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering.  Alex is exploring new approaches to formation maneuvering control while Arie will develop new control architectures for quadcopter drones.

Welcome to the Connect Lab and good luck!

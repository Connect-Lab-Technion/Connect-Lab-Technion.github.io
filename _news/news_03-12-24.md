title: "New paper on A Characterization of Passivizing Input-Output Transformations of
Nonlinear MIMO Systems!"
date: 2024-12-03
description: To appear in the IEEE Control Systems Letters

This work extends our recent results on feedback passivation of SISO systems.  Here, we extend our analysis to MIMO systems providing a characterization of all linear passivizing transformations for passive short systems.  The MIMO formulation hints at embedding additional performance requirements on passivizing transformations establishing a link between optimal control design and passivation techniques.

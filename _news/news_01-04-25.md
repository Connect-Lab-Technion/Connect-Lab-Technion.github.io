---

Evyatar Matmon, an MSc student in the group, presented his work on Leader Identification in Semi-Autonomous Consensus Networks.  This work is part of a more challenging problem of trying to identify the structure of a multi-agent network from observations of trajectories alone.  In Evyatar's work, the focus is on identifying leaders in a semi-autonomous consensus networks.  

Evyatar presented his poster at the Technion Autonomous Systems Program (TASP) research day.

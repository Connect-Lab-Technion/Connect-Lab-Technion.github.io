title: "New paper on Symmetry Forced Formation Control!"
date: 2025-01-04
description: To appear in the IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems

Symmetry is a beautiful and pervasive phenomenon in nature, art, and mathematics. It inspires elegance in design and efficiency in problem-solving. In our newly published paper (to appear), we explore how symmetry can be exploited to create sparse formation control algorithms. Leveraging recent results on symmetry-forced rigidity theory by my colleagues Bernd Schulze (Lancaster University) and Shin-Ichi Tanigawa (University of Tokyo), symmetry constraints on a formation are exploited to reduce the sensing and communication burden of a formation seeking multi-robot system.

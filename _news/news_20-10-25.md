title: "New paper on bearing-only formation control over directed graphs!"
date: 2025-10-15
description: To appear in the IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems

This work, led by MSc student Jiacheng Shi, introduces a generalization of the leader-first follower (LFF) graph structure for solving the bearing-only formation control (BOFC) problem on directed graphs.

The paper develops a theoretical foundation for systems with one follower and multiple leaders, providing explicit equilibrium and stability analyses. Building on these results, it proposes an extended framework—ordered LFF graphs—that allows for additional forward-directed edges while preserving system stability. This generalization broadens the class of directed networks that can achieve stable formation control and demonstrates faster convergence compared to the traditional LFF structures.

The study represents an important step toward more flexible and high-performance formation control strategies for multi-agent systems under directed sensing.

The work will appear in the IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems.  

Congratulations Jiacheng!

title: "ISF Grant on Formation Control over Directed Graphs"
date: 2024-08-07
description: A new 4-year grant trying to understand the complex problem of solving formation control with directed sensing.
---

The [Israel Science Foundation](https://www.isf.org.il/) will fund our research on *Formation Control Over Directed Graphs*.  This project work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical advances and real-world applications in coordinating multiple vehicles or robots into specific spatial configurations without relying on global positioning systems.  Our main objectives are to extend combinatorial rigidity theory for directed constraint frameworks and analyze distributed control algorithms for formation control in directed networks. 

Stay tuned for future developments as we attack this problem!

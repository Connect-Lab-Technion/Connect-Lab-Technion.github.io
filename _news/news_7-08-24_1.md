title: "ISF Grant on Formation Control over Directed Graphs"
date: 2024-08-07
description: A new 4-year grant trying to understand the complex problem of solving formation control with directed sensing.
---

The [Israel Science Foundation](https://www.isf.org.il/) will fund our research on *Formation Control Over Directed Graphs*.  Our main objectives for this project are to extend combinatorial rigidity theory for directed constraint frameworks and analyze distributed control algorithms for formation control in directed networks. 

Stay tuned for future developments as we attack this problem!

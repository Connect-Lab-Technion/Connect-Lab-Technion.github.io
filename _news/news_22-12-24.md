The Conference on Decision and Control is the premier meeting for anyone doing research in control theory. It is always a wonderful time to meet with old friends and colleagues and see what are the hot topics in controls these days.  Gal Barkai gave an excellent talk on his work on synchronization with sampled-data and time delay constraints.

Already looking forward to the next one!

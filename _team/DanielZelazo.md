bio: "
I am an associate professor in the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering.  My academic trajectory has sent me through a few engineering departments, although my focus has always been on the rich field of systems & control theory.  I received my B.Sc. (’99) and M.Eng. (’01) degrees in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  After completing my master’s degree, I moved to Tsukuba, Japan to work on audio compression algorithms as a research engineer at Texas Instruments.  After a slight perturbation to my career path as an English teacher, I eventually ended up at the University of Washington to pursue my doctorate (’09) under the guidance of Prof. Mehran Mesbahi.  I then moved to Stuttgart, Germany as a postdoctoral research associate at the Institute for Systems Theory and Automatic Control under the supervision Prof. Frank Allgöwer.  I joined the Technion in October of 2012.

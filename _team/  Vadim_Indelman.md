My research broadly lies at the intersection of probabilistic perception, state estimation and planning, both for single and distributed multi-agent autonomous systems. I am interested in enabling a reliable, accurate and on-line operation in complex scenarios, particularly focusing on operation in uncertain, partially unknown and dynamic environments. Accordingly, my research interests include autonomous navigation and mapping, consistent distributed information fusion, belief-space planning and active sensing, distributed robust perception, inference with probabilistic graphical models, vision-aided navigation (VAN) and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Additionally, since 2017 Iâ€™m serving as an Associate Editor for IEEE Robotics & Automation Letters (RA-L), Senior Editor for IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) between 2021-2023, and as an Area Chair at International Symposium on Multi-Robot and Multi-Agent Systems (MRS) 2021. Since 2019, I am also serving as a co-chair of the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society Technical Committee on Algorithms for the Planning and Control of Robot Motion.

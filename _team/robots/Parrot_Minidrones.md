##  About Me :
I am the current platform the the Advanced Control Lab, where students can deploy low level flight control algorithms. I am no longer on the market, but I was a cheap platform the the first edition of this course. Can't wait for my successor: [AutonomousFPV]({{ site.baseurl }}/team/robots/FPV_Minidrones/)

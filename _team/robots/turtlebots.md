##  About Me :

I am the first robotics testbed for the Connect Lab! I am based on the open source turtlebot ROS project. I am equiped with 2-d range mobility through a unicycle model and can be equiped with a camera and rangefinder hardware for bearing and distance formation control algorithm deployment. Can't wait for my successor: [MechanumBot]({{ site.baseurl }}/team/robots/Mechanum_bots/)

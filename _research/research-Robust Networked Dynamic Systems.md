Modeling and design of complex networked systems requires both a physical understanding of the dynamic systems comprising the network, and the information exchange network that couples these systems together.  A great challenge in the general understanding of these systems is how to manage uncertainties in the network.  This includes uncertainties in both the dynamic modeling of the individual systems and in the structure and information flow of the information exchange network.  This project aims to address the notions of uncertainties and robustness in networked dynamic systems.  The core problems we study are

1. Given a nominal description of a networked dynamic system, how do perturbations and uncertainties in the network structure and the individual agents in the network affect the overall performance of the system.
2. Given a performance specification for a networked dynamic system, develop numerically tractable algorithms and procedures for the design of the network structure.

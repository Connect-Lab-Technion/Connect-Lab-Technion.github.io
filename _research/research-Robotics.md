While the primary focus of research in our group is on the theoretical foundations of network system, we also recognize the importance of validating our ideas on real-world systems.  A multi-robot testbed provides an excellent platform to test our ideas and also attract undergraduate students to our research group.  We are developing both ground and aerial robots for this puprose.  We also collaborate with roboticsts to help realize our more sophisticated research ideas.

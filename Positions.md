<!-- # Positions -->
We are *always* looking for motivated individuals to join our research group. Further details are given below:
* [Postdoctoral Research Fellows](#Postdoctoral)
* [Graduate Students (M.Sc. and Ph.D.)](#GraduateStudents)
* [Undergraduate students](#underGraduateStudents)

## Postdoctoral Research Fellows
<div id="Postdoctoral"></div>
Multiple postdoctoral research fellow positions are available in the area of control and coordination of multi-agent systems.

Successful candidates will work with Associate Prof. Daniel Zelazo and his research group, and will have the opportunity to contribute to ongoing multi-disciplinary research efforts while also developing their own research line. Applicants should have a Ph.D. (or about to graduate) in Electrical, Aerospace or Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science or Applied Mathematics. A strong background in at least one of the areas mentioned above is required. 

This is a full-time, one-year, non-tenure-track appointment with possibility of extension subject to available funding and satisfactory performance. Funds for some conference travel and research expenses will also be provided. Starting date is flexible.

Applicants are encouraged to send by email a cover letter that briefly describes their background and career plans, a CV and copies of up to three relevant publications. For more information please explore this website, or contact Associate Prof. Daniel Zelazo via [email](mailto:dzelazo@technion.ac.il).


## Graduate Students (M.Sc. and Ph.D.)
<div id="GraduateStudents"></div>
The Cooperative Networks and Controls Lab (ConNeCt) is seeking motivated students to pursue a MSc or PhD degree. We are looking for students with a broad interest in multi-agent and network control theory. Problems we consider include, but are not limited to

- control and coordination of multi-robot systems
- design of robust and resilient network systems
- networked event-triggered control problems
- graph-theoretic methods for control of multi-agent systems

The successful candidate should have a strong background in control theory and mathematics.

Interested candidates are invited to send a copy of their CV, academic transcript, and brief research statement to Prof. Daniel Zelazo [email](mailto:dzelazo@technion.ac.il).

## Undergraduate students 
<div id="underGraduateStudents"></div>
Undergraduate student? Join us and get involved in research activities early. You will have the opportunity to learn cutting-edge technology in robotics and multi-agent controls.

Motivated and eager students are encouraged to get in touch by [email](mailto:dzelazon@technion.ac.il).

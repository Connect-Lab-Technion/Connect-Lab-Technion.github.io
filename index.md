# Welcome to the Autonomous Navigation and Perception Lab (ANPL) at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology.

ANPL investigates problems related to single and multi-robot collaborative autonomous navigation and perception, with a particular focus on accurate and reliable operation in uncertain environments. Research in the lab is highly multidisciplinary, involving both fundamental theoretical studies and experimental verification. Please visit [Research](https://anpl-technion.github.io/research/) and [Publications](https://anpl-technion.github.io/publications/) pages to see ongoing research activities. The lab was founded by Associate Professor Vadim Indelman in November 2014.

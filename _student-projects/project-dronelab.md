abstract: Integration of new drone platform for Advanced Control Lab
---

The Advanced Control Lab (085705) is structured around the Parrot Simulink Hardware Support Toolbox. Recently, the Parrot drones and their components were taken off the market. The objective of this project is to design a new drone platform with open source materials that could be substituted directly into the course. 
The new platform can act as an improvement from the Parrot drone, in response to student and instructor feedback.  

So far, an Ardupilot toolchain for Simulink has been developed to replace the Parrot Simulink Toolbox.  A proof of concept drone is developed and is being tested for completeness with the course syllubus. 
Once the proof of concept is well tested, drones will be designed for production and integrated into the course. 

Possible student involvement includes the design and integration of hardware for the new frame, designing the user inteface for the students, and testing of the proof of concept with the course syllubus.

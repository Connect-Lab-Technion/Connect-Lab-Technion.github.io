We are considering new actuation and power delivery approaches to quadcopters. In this project we explore the control laws for a quadcopter equiped with a micro-gas turbine that can be used for power delivery and thrust. The first phase of the project is to design stabilizing controllers, with the goal of building a quad with an MGT.  The project is in collaboration with the [Turbomachinery and Heat Transfer Laboratory

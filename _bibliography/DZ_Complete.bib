@article{Barkai2023a_J,
 abstract = {We study internal stability in the context of diffusively-coupled control architectures, common in multi-agent systems (i.e. the celebrated consensus protocol), for linear time-invariant agents. We derive a condition under which the system cannot be stabilized by any controller from that class. In the finite-dimensional case the condition states that diffusive controllers cannot stabilize agents that share common unstable dynamics, directions included. This class always contains the group of homogeneous unstable agents, like integrators. We argue that the underlying reason is intrinsic cancellations of unstable agent dynamics by such controllers, even static ones, where directional properties play a key role. The intrinsic lack of internal stability explains the notorious behavior of some distributed control protocols when affected by measurement noise or exogenous disturbances.},

 abstract = {For a given graph G of order n with m edges, and a real symmetric matrix associated to the graph, M(G)∈Rn×n, the interlacing graph reduction problem is to find a graph Gr of order r<n such that the eigenvalues of M(Gr) interlace the eigenvalues of M(G). Graph contractions over partitions of the vertices are widely used as a combinatorial graph reduction tool. In this study, we derive a graph reduction interlacing theorem based on subspace mappings and the minmax theory. We then define a class of edge-matching graph contractions and show how two types of edge-matching contractions provide Laplacian and normalized Laplacian interlacing. An O(mn) algorithm is provided for finding a normalized Laplacian interlacing contraction and an O(n2+nm) algorithm is provided for finding a Laplacian interlacing contraction.},

@article{Priel2023_J,
 abstract = {Abstract This work introduces an improved design approach for distributed event-triggering consensus Kalman filtering (DETCKF). We consider a network of sensors that are able to observe a linear discrete-time stochastic process with known dynamics. The sensors cooperate through information exchange over a possibly time-varying communication network to obtain an estimate of the process state. We propose event-triggering conditions and consensus gains for which the error dynamics of the filter are stable. Both are derived from a Lyapunov-based stability analysis. We also propose an event-triggering scheme for scenarios in which some of the agents have intermittent observability of the process—that is, they are not able to measure the process dynamics. Under mild conditions on the sensing architecture, we show that even in this case it is possible to design a stable event-triggered estimate of the process state. We validate our results with numerical simulations and compare with other solutions in the literature.},

Given the number of clusters and agents within each cluster, we design the network graph ensuring the system will converge to the prescribed cluster configuration. Using recent results linking clustering and symmetries, we show that it is possible to design an oriented graph for which the action of the automorphism group of the graph has orbits of predetermined sizes, guaranteeing the network will converge to the prescribed cluster configuration. We provide bounds on the number of edges needed to construct these graphs along with a constructive approach for their generation. We also consider the robustness of the clustering process under agent malfunction.},

@inproceedings{Zelazo2009,
 abstract = {This work provides a general framework for the analysis and synthesis of a class of linear networked dynamic systems (NDS). We focus our attention on NDS where the underlying connection topology couples the agents at their outputs. A distinction is made between NDS with homogeneous agent dynamics and NDS with heterogeneous agent dynamics. In the homogeneous setting, the H2 norm expression reduces to the Frobenius norm of the underlying connection topology incidence matrix, E(G), scaled by the H2 norm of the agents comprising the NDS. In the heterogeneous case, the H2 norm becomes the weighted Frobenius norm of the incidence matrix, where the weights appear on the nodes of the graph. The H2 norm characterization is then used to synthesize NDS with certain H2 performance. Specifically, a semi-definite programming solution is presented to design a local controller for each agent when the underlying topology is fixed. A solution using Kruskal's algorithm for finding a minimum weight spanning tree is used to design the optimal NDS topology given fixed agent dynamics.},

abstract = {This work considers the economic dispatch problem for a single micro gas turbine, governed by a discrete state–space model, under combined heat and power (CHP) operation and coupled with a utility. If the exact power and heat demands are given, existing algorithms can be used to give a quick optimal solution to the economic dispatch problem. However, in practice, the power and heat demands cannot be known deterministically, but are rather predicted, resulting in an estimate and a bound on the estimation error. We consider the case in which the power and heat demands are unknown, and present a robust optimization-based approach for scheduling the turbine's heat and power generation, in which the demand is assumed to be inside an uncertainty set. We consider two different choices of the uncertainty set relying on the ℓ∞- and the ℓ1-norms, each with different advantages, and consider the associated robust economic dispatch problems. We recast these as robust shortest-path problems on appropriately defined graphs. For the first choice, we provide an exact linear-time algorithm for the solution of the robust shortest-path problem, and for the second, we provide an exact quadratic-time algorithm and an approximate linear-time algorithm. The efficiency and usefulness of the algorithms are demonstrated using a detailed case study that employs real data on energy demand profiles and electricity tariffs.},

This factor is derived from an LMI appearing in the stability analysis of the DCKF and can be computed using semi-definite programming. We also propose a decentralized consensus gain that can be computed by each agent in the sensor network, and depends only on local properties of the network, i.e., the number of neighbors of each sensor. We show in simulation that this approach holds even for networks with time varying communication regime.

abstract = {Equilibrium-independent passive-short (EIPS) systems are a class of systems that satisfy a passivity-like dissipation inequality with respect to any forced equilibria with nonpositive passivity indices. This article presents a geometric approach for finding a passivizing transformation for such systems, relying on their steady-state input-output relation and the notion of projective quadratic inequalities (PQIs). We show that PQIs arise naturally from passivity-shortage characteristics of an EIPS system, and the set of their solutions can be explicitly expressed. We leverage this connection to build an input-output mapping that transforms the steady-state input-output relation to a monotone relation, and show that the same mapping passivizes the EIPS system. We show that the proposed transformation can be implemented through a combination of feedback, feedthrough, post- and premultiplication gains. Furthermore, we consider an application of the presented passivation scheme for the analysis of networks comprised of EIPS systems. Numerous examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical findings.},

abstract = {Fault detection and isolation is an area of engineering dealing with designing on-line protocols for systems that allow one to identify the existence of faults, pinpoint their exact location, and overcome them. We consider the case of multi-agent systems, where faults correspond to the disappearance of links in the underlying graph, simulating a communication failure between the corresponding agents. We study the case in which the agents and controllers are maximal equilibrium-independent passive (MEIP), and use the known connection between steady-states of these multi-agent systems and network optimization theory. We first study asymptotic methods of differentiating the faultless system from its faulty versions by studying their steady-state outputs. We explain how to apply the asymptotic differentiation to detect and isolate communication faults, with graph-theoretic guarantees on the number of faults that can be isolated, assuming the existence of a "convergence assertion protocol", a data-driven method of asserting that a multi-agent system converges to a conjectured limit. We then construct two data-driven model-based convergence assertion protocols. We demonstrate our results by a case study.},

abstract = {This work analyzes the convergence properties of signed networks with nonlinear edge functions. We consider diffusively coupled networks comprised of maximal equilibrium-independent passive (MEIP) dynamics on the nodes, and a general class of nonlinear coupling functions on the edges. The first contribution of this work is to generalize the classical notion of signed networks for graphs with scalar weights to graphs with nonlinear edge functions using notions from passivity theory. We show that the output of the network can finally form one or several steady-state clusters if all edges are positive, and in particular, all nodes can reach an output agreement if there is a connected subnetwork spanning all nodes and strictly positive edges. When there are non-positive edges added to the network, we show that the tension of the network still converges to the equilibria of the edge functions if the relative outputs of the nodes connected by non-positive edges converge to their equilibria. Furthermore, we establish the equivalent circuit models for signed nonlinear networks, and define the concept of equivalent edge functions which is a generalization of the notion of effective resistance. We finally characterize the relationship between the convergence property and the equivalent edge function, when a non-positive edge is added to a strictly positive network comprised of nonlinear integrators. We show that the convergence of the network is always guaranteed, if the sum of the equivalent edge function of the previous network and the new edge function is passive.},

abstract = {This paper studies analysis and synthesis problems for diffusively coupled multi-agent systems. We focus on networks comprised of multi-input multi-output nonlinear systems that possess a property we term maximal equilibrium-independent cyclically monotone passivity (MEICMP), which is an extension of recent passivity results. We demonstrate that networks comprised of MEICMP systems are related to a pair of dual network optimization problems. In particular, we show that the steady-state behavior of the multi-agent system correspond to the minimizers of appropriately defined network optimization problems. This optimization perspective leads to a synthesis procedure for designing the network controllers to achieve a desired output. We provide detailed examples of networked systems satisfying these properties and demonstrate the results for a network of damped planar oscillators.},

abstract = {In this letter, we propose a network-optimization framework for the analysis of multi-agent systems with passive-short agents. We consider the known connection between diffusively coupled maximally equilibrium-independent passive systems, and network optimization, culminating in a pair of dual convex network optimization problems, whose minimizers are exactly the steady-states of the closed-loop system. We propose a network-based regularization term to the network optimization problem and show that it results in a network-based feedback using only relative outputs. We prove that if the average of the passivity indices is positive, then we convexify the problem, passivize the agents, and that steady-states of the augmented system correspond to the minimizers of the regularized network optimization problem. We also suggest a hybrid approach, in which only a subset of agents sense their own output, and show that if the set is nonempty, then we can always achieve the same correspondence as above, regardless of the passivity indices. We demonstrate our results on a traffic model with non-passive agents and limited GNSS reception.},

However, the theory for nonlinear agents remains less extensive. We use the notion maximal equilibrium-independent passivity (MEIP) and network optimization theory to present a network identification method for nonlinear agents.We do so by introducing a specially designed exogenous input, and exploiting the properties of networked MEIP systems. We then specialize on LTI agents, showing that the method gives a distributed cubic-time algorithm for network reconstruction in that case. We also discuss different methods of choosing the exogenous input, and provide an example on a neural network model.},

abstract = {Multi-agent systems (MAS) have been an important area of study over the past few years. In this work we consider a MAS where a team of agents must coordinate to reach an agreement on their state in finite-time, while simultaneously attempting to minimize their own cost functions. Agents cooperate with each other by means of communication, and thus an additional requirement is the agents maintain their communication network during their trajectories - this leads to a constraint on the distances between neighbouring agents. We propose a real time sub-optimal solution for this agreement problem. The algorithm is based on the well-known dual sub-gradient algorithm for solving distributed optimization problems. To ensure the algorithm does not violate the distance connectivity constraints between neighbouring agents, we propose a modification to the sub-gradient algorithm that projects the Lagrange multipliers associated with the distance constraints onto a bounded set that ensures the distance between neighbouring agents remains within the prescribed limits. The main contribution for this work is an algorithm that solves the problem for the 2-agent case. We demonstrate the result using numerical simulations.},

We show that if either the negative weight edges form a cut in the graph, or any single negative edge weight has magnitude less than the inverse of the effective resistance between the two incident nodes, then the resulting network is unstable. These results are then applied to analyze the robustness properties of the consensus network with additive but bounded perturbations of the edge weights. It is shown that the small-gain condition is related again to cuts in the graph and effective resistance. For the single edge case, the small-gain condition is also shown to be exact. The results are then extended to consensus networks with non-linear couplings.},

We show that the bearing rigidity of a network is a generic property that is critically determined by the underlying graph of the network. We define a new notion termed generic bearing rigidity for graphs. If the underlying graph of a network is generically bearing rigid, then the network is bearing rigid for almost all configurations; otherwise, the network is not bearing rigid for any configuration. The main contribution of this paper is to prove that Laman graphs, which can be generated by the Henneberg construction, are generically bearing rigid. As a result, given a Laman graph, the corresponding network is bearing rigid for almost all configurations in an arbitrary dimension.},

abstract = {This work proposes a fully decentralized strategy for maintaining the formation rigidity of a multi-robot system using only range measurements, while still allowing the graph topology to change freely over time. In this direction, a first contribution of this work is an extension of rigidity theory to weighted frameworks and the rigidity eigenvalue, which when positive ensures the infinitesimal rigidity of the framework. We then propose a distributed algorithm for estimating a common relative position reference frame amongst a team of robots with only range measurements in addition to one agent endowed with the capability of measuring the bearing to two other agents. This first estimation step is embedded into a subsequent distributed algorithm for estimating the rigidity eigenvalue associated with the weighted framework. The estimate of the rigidity eigenvalue is finally used to generate a local control action for each agent that both maintains the rigidity property and enforces additional constraints such as collision avoidance and sensing/communication range limits and occlusions. As an additional feature of our approach, the communication and sensing links among the robots are also left free to change over time while preserving rigidity of the whole framework. The proposed scheme is then experimentally validated with a robotic testbed consisting of six quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles operating in a cluttered environment.},

This paper considers a formation control problem for a team of agents that are only able to sense the relative bearings from their local body frame to neighboring agents. It is further assumed that the sensing graph is inherently directed and a common reference frame is not known to all of the agents. Each agent is tasked with maintaining predetermined bearings with their neighbors. Using the recently developed rigidity theory for SE(2) frameworks [1], we propose a gradient-type controller to stabilize the formation. The central construct in the SE(2) rigidity theory for this work is the directed bearing rigidity matrix. We show that a necessary condition for the local stabilization of desired formation is for the corresponding SE(2) framework to be minimally infinitesimally rigid.},

abstract = {We established in this paper an explicit connection between passivity-based cooperative control problems and the classical network optimization framework. A main contribution of this work is to reveal that duality relations known in network theory translate directly to the cooperative control setting. We study a general cooperative control problem involving passive dynamical systems and show that the asymptotic configuration is optimal with respect to a pair of dual optimization problems, an optimal potential and an optimal flow problem, defined by the equilibrium input-to-output maps of the dynamical systems and the nonlinear coupling functions, respectively. This connection provides a powerful methodology to analyze more complex problems. We then proceed to study a cooperative control problem with saturated coupling functions that exhibits partial output agreement, or clustering, in its asymptotic behavior. This clustering phenomenon is then interpreted and analyzed in the context of the network optimization framework. The novel connection between cooperative control and network optimization provides a unifying framework for network analysis and feedback design. We illustrate the potential of the results on a traffic dynamics model.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2013 Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Rigidity of formations in multi-robot systems is important for formation control, localization, and sensor fusion. This work proposes a rigidity maintenance gradient controller for a multi-Agent robot team. To develop such a controller, we first provide an alternative characterization of the rigidity matrix and use that to introduce the novel concept of the rigidity eigenvalue. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition relating the positivity of the rigidity eigenvalue to the rigidity of the formation. The rigidity maintenance controller is based on the gradient of the rigidity eigenvalue with respect to each robot position. This gradient has a naturally distributed structure, and is thus amenable to a distributed implementation. Additional requirements such as obstacle and inter-Agent collision avoidance, as well as typical constraints such as limited sensing/communication ranges and line-of-sight occlusions, are also explicitly considered. Finally, we present a simulation with a group of seven quadrotor UAVs to demonstrate and validate the theoretical results.},

abstract = {This work presents a distributed algorithm for online negotiations of an optimal control policy be- tween dynamical systems. We consider a network of self-interested agents that must agree upon a common state within a specified finite-time. The proposed algorithm exploits the distributed structure of the corresponding dual problem and uses a “shrinking horizon” property to enforce the finite-time constraint. It is shown that this algo- rithm evolves like a time-varying and linear dynamical system, parameterized by a scalar variable analogous to the step-size rule in sub-gradient methods. The convergence and performance properties of the system are studied in the context of error systems between the algorithm trajectories and a sequence of centralized optimal control trajecto- ries. This analysis provides a simple LMI condition for choosing a proper step-size rule, and also gives conditions for when no step-size rule can guarantee uniform convergence of the error systems. These conditions are shown to be functions of communication graph Laplacian eigenvalues, and the state and control weights of each agent. We also provide a lower bound on the horizon time that guarantees that the terminal state generated by the algorithm is $\delta$-close to an agreement state. The results are then demonstrated via a few numerical simulations. Key},

abstract = {Next generation power management at all scales will rely on the efficient scheduling and operation of both generating units and loads to maximize efficiency and utility. The ability to schedule and modulate the demand levels of a subset of loads within a power system can lead to more efficient use of the generating units. These methods become increasingly important for systems that operate independently of the main utility, such as microgrid and off-grid systems. This work extends the principles of unit commitment and economic dispatch problems to off-grid power systems where the loads are also schedulable. We propose a general optimization framework for solving the energy management problem in these systems. An important contribution is the description of how a wide range of sources and loads, including those with discrete states, non-convex, and nonlinear cost or utility functions, can be reformulated as a convex optimization problem using, for example, a shortest path description. Once cast in this way, solution are obtainable using a subgradient algorithm that also lends itself to a distributed implementation. The methods are demonstrated by a simulation of an off-grid solar powered community. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2012.},

abstract = {This work provides a general framework for the analysis and synthesis of a class of linear networked dynamic systems (NDS). We focus our attention on NDS where the underlying connection topology couples the agents at their outputs. A distinction is made between NDS with homogeneous agent dynamics and NDS with heterogeneous agent dynamics. In the homogeneous setting, the H2 norm expression reduces to the Frobenius norm of the underlying connection topology incidence matrix, E(G), scaled by the H2 norm of the agents comprising the NDS. In the heterogeneous case, the H2 norm becomes the weighted Frobenius norm of the incidence matrix, where the weights appear on the nodes of the graph. The H2 norm characterization is then used to synthesize NDS with certain H2 performance. Specifically, a semi-definite programming solution is presented to design a local controller for each agent when the underlying topology is fixed. A solution using Kruskal's algorithm for finding a minimum weight spanning tree is used to design the optimal NDS topology given fixed agent dynamics.},

We first give a strengthened definition of bearing equivalence based on the \textit{kernel equivalence} relationship between bearing rigidity matrix and bearing Laplacian matrix. We then present several conditions to characterize bearing equivalence for both directed acyclic and cyclic graphs. These conditions involve the spectrum and null space of the associated bearing Laplacian matrix for a directed bearing formation. For directed acyclic graphs, all eigenvalues of the associated bearing Laplacian are real and nonnegative, while for directed graphs containing cycles, the bearing Laplacian can have eigenvalues with negative real parts. Several examples of bearing equivalent and bearing non-equivalent formations are given to illustrate these conditions.},

abstract = {The analysis and synthesis of large-scale systems pose a range of challenges due to the number of their subsystems and the complexity of their interactions. In the meantime, the importance of these systems has become increasingly prevalent in science and engineering, especially in the realm of multi-agent systems such as coordination of autonomous vehicles on ground, in sea, air, and space, as well as localization and sensor fusion, energy networks, and distributed computation [1,2,4-7,9,19,21]. One aspect of the complexity of large-scale systems is that their subsystems, which we occasionally refer to as 'agents,' may not be described by the same set of inputoutput dynamics. The difference between the dynamics of distinct subsystems may be the result of manufacturing inconsistencies or intentional differences due to varying requirements for each subsystem in the ensemble. An important component to the analysis of these systems, therefore, is to understand how heterogeneity in the subsystem dynamics affects the behavior and performance of the entire system. Another facet of this complexity relates to the interconnection of different subsystems. The underlying interconnection topology of a large-scale system may be determined by the governing dynamic equations of each subsystem, e.g., when the interconnection is a function of some state of each subsystem, or it may be designed as part of the engineering process. In both cases, the interconnection topology has a profound impact on the overall system in terms of its stability, controllability, observability, and performance. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {This article studies two distributed bearing‐based event‐triggered schemes to achieve formation stabilization. We focus on systems with double‐integrator dynamics with bearings sensing capabilities. Firstly, we propose a bearing‐only event‐triggered condition (ETC) that is edge‐dependent which drives the control updates of the agents using only information dependent on relative sensed quantities. Secondly, along with bearing measurements we make use of local agent state measurements to arrive at an ETC that uses this collective measurement to drive the sensing and control updates of an agent.

abstract = {This paper studies the problem of distributed control of bearing-constrained multi-agent formations using bearing-only measurements. We first propose a bearing rigidity theory that is applicable to frameworks in arbitrary dimensions. The proposed bearing rigidity theory is then used to solve two bearing-only formation control problems. In the first, each agent can measure the relative bearings to their neighbors in a global reference frame, while in the second problem, each agent can only measure the bearings and relative orientations of their neighbors in their local frames. For each problem we propose a distributed bearing-only control law and prove the almost global formation stability.},

We represent a sparsity pattern by a matrix with <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$0/\star$</tex-math></inline-formula>-entries, where <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\star$</tex-math></inline-formula>-entries are arbitrary real numbers and 0-entries are equal to 0. We say that a sparsity pattern has full structural rank if the maximal rank of matrices contained in it is <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$n$</tex-math></inline-formula>. In this paper, we investigate the degree of resilience of patterns with full structural rank: We address questions such as how many <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\star$</tex-math></inline-formula>-entries can be removed without decreasing the structural rank and, reciprocally, how many <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$\star$</tex-math></inline-formula>-entries one needs to add so as to increase the said degree of resilience to reach a target. Our approach goes by translating these questions into max-flow problems on appropriately defined bipartite graphs. Based on these translations, we provide algorithms that solve the problems in polynomial time.},

@article{Fabris2022,
abstract = {This work mainly addresses continuous-time multi-agent consensus networks where an adverse attacker affects the convergence performances of said protocol. In particular, we develop a novel secure-by-design approach in which the presence of a network manager monitors the system and broadcasts encrypted tasks (i.e. hidden edge weight assignments) to the agents involved. Each agent is then expected to decode the received codeword containing data on the task through appropriate decoding functions by leveraging advanced security principles, such as objective coding and information localization. Within this framework, a stability analysis is conducted for showing the robustness to channel tampering in the scenario where part of the codeword corresponding to a single link in the system is corrupted. A trade-off between objective coding capabilityand network robustness is also pointed out. To support these novelties, an application example on decentralized estimation is provided. Moreover, such an investigation on robust stability is as well extended in the discrete-time domain. Further numerical simulations are given to validate the theoretical results in both the time domains.},

abstract = {This work focuses on bearing rigidity theory, namely the branch of knowledge investigating the structural properties necessary for multi-element systems to preserve the inter-unit bearings under deformations. The contributions of this work are twofold. The first one consists in the development of a general framework for the statement of the principal definitions and properties of bearing rigidity. We show that this approach encompasses results existing in the literature, and also provides a systematic approach for studying bearing rigidity on any differential manifold in SE(3)^n, where n is the number of agents. The second contribution is the derivation of a general form of the rigidity matrix, a central construct in the study of rigidity theory. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the infinitesimal rigidity of a bearing framework as a property of the rank of the rigidity matrix. Finally, we present two examples of multi-agent systems not encountered in the literature and we study their rigidity properties using the developed methods.},

Graph contractions over partitions of the vertices are widely used as a combinatorial graph reduction tool. In this study, we derive a graph reduction interlacing theorem based on subspace mappings and the minmax theory. We then define a class of edge-matching graph contractions and show how two types of edge-matching contractions provide Laplacian and normalized Laplacian interlacing. An O(mn) algorithm is provided for finding a normalized Laplacian interlacing contraction and an O(n2+nm) algorithm is provided for finding a Laplacian interlacing contraction.},

The controller is comprised of a fixed controller with an adjustable gain on each edge. Via passivity theory and network optimization we not only prove that there exists a gain attaining the desired formation control goal, but we present a data-based method to find an upper bound on this gain. Furthermore, by allowing for additional experiments, the conservatism of the upper bound can be reduced via iterative sampling schemes. The introduced scheme is based on the assumption of passive systems, which we relax by discussing different methods for estimating the systems' passivity shortage, as well as applying transformations passivizing them. Finally, we illustrate the developed model-free cooperative control scheme with a case study.},

By formalising the relationship between the formation and the gradient estimation error, we provide a novel analysis to prove the convergence of the network to a bounded neighbourhood of the field's time varying extrema.
